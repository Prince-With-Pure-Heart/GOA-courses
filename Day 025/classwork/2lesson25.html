    <h2>Eren</h2>
    <p>Eren Yeager (Japanese: エレン・イェーガー, Hepburn: Eren Yēgā), also spelled Eren Jaeger (Turkish: Eren, "Saint"; German: Jaeger/Jäger, "Hunter"), is the protagonist of the Attack on Titan manga series created by Hajime Isayama. Eren is a teenager who swears revenge on enormous man-eating humanoid creatures known as Titans, who have forced what remains of the human race to live in walled off cities and devoured his mother while destroying his home town in the Shiganshina district of Wall Maria. In order to defeat the Titans, Eren enlists in the Military and joins the Survey Corps—an elite group of soldiers who fight Titans outside the walls and also study the physiology of Titans in order to know what they are fighting. As the story progresses, Eren gains the power of becoming a Titan later identified as "Attack Titan" (進撃の巨人, Shingeki no Kyojin). He has also appeared in other related media including anime and video games.

        Isayama created Eren with the idea of a character whose fears and dreams were relatable but often clashed with his own darkness, resulting into multiple changes to his characterization. In the anime adaptation of the series, Eren has been voiced by Yūki Kaji in Japanese and Bryce Papenbrook in English. Both of these actors found difficulties in employing different types of voices based on how Eren grows up across the narrative. In the live-action film adaptations, he is portrayed by Haruma Miura.
        
        Critical reception to Eren was initially polarized, finding him too antagonistic and harsh for his age. Positive comments focused on the character's ideals and newfound powers as a Titan as well as his character arc. Reception has become more positive in later arcs of the manga and anime as he becomes a more ambiguous rather than heroic character, evidenced in the 6th Crunchyroll Anime Awards where Eren was nominated for "Best Protagonist" and "Best Antagonist" simultaneously, and went on to win in the latter category. The character has proven popular within the Attack on Titan fanbase, while his voice actors Kaji and Papenbrook received praise for their portrayals of the character.

    <h2>Mikasa</h2>
    <p>Mikasa Ackerman (ミカサ・アッカーマン, Mikasa Akkāman, alt. "Mikasa Ackermann") is a fictional character from Hajime Isayama's manga series Attack on Titan. Mikasa is introduced as a citizen of Paradis Island living with the protagonist, Eren Yeager, and his family, who took her in following the deaths of her parents in an attempted kidnapping. When giant creatures known as Titans invade the area and eat Eren's mother, Mikasa and Eren become members of the Military and join the Survey Corps—an elite group of soldiers who fight Titans outside the walls and also study the physiology of Titans in order to know what they are fighting. Mikasa's main motivation for fighting is her love for Eren, of whom she is extremely protective. She has also appeared in video games and the anime adaptation.

        Isayama based Mikasa on a real person he met before he became a manga artist, keeping the original idea of her being Asian in order to stand out within the Western look-a-like cast. Mikasa is voiced by Yui Ishikawa in Japanese and Trina Nishimura in English. The two voice actresses were surprised by the popularity of their works and the charming aspect of Mikasa despite her usual stoicism.
        
        Mikasa's strong presence received a positive response. Being a member of the Ackermann clan, Mikasa demonstrates an outstanding skill in combat. Though she was praised for her calm personality which contrasts Eren's generally intense behavior, critics were also surprised by the softer side she shows towards Eren. Both voice actresses were also praised by the media.</p>
